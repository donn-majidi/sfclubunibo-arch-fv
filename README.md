See [Requirements](#requirements) for the list of required packages.

## Workflow

## Usage Example
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from src.models.validator import Validator

## The following is an illustrative example using data fetched from yahoo finance.
# pip install yfinance #run this line if yfinance is not already installed.
import yfinance as yf
sp500 = yf.Ticker('^GSPC').history(start='2022-01-01')
returns = np.log(sp500['Close']).diff() * 100 ## Always a good idea to multiply returns by 100
returns = returns.dropna()

## Import arch model constructor
from arch import arch_model
mod1 = arch_model(returns, vol='GARCH', p=1, o=0, q=1, dist='gaussian') ## GARCH(1,1) with Gaussian likelihood function.
mod2 = arch_model(returns, vol='GARCH', p=1, o=1, q=1, dist='studentst') ## GJR_GARCH(1,1,1) with Studend-t likelihood function.

## Create array of model instances
models = np.asarray([mod1, mod2], dtype=object) ## The dtype of the array has to be explicitly set to object.

## Create and instance of the Validator class
model_validator = Validator(endog=returns, models=models)

## Set the input parameters to feed to the validate() method
ws = 252  # Window size
fh = 1    # Forecast horizon
alpha = [0.01,0.05]  # Significance levels for Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall estimation. This parameter is optional.
align = 'target'  # Index align method for out-of-sample forecasts and corresponding losses. If not passed, the default align method will be used: 'origin'.

model_validator.validate(window_size=ws, horizon=fh, alpha = alpha, align=align)
```
> [!NOTE]
> 1. Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall forecasts will only be computed if a value for alpha is passed to the validate() method.
>
> 2. The default index align method for the out-of-sample forecasts is 'origin' as in the default behavior of the forecast() method in the arch package. Setting the align method to 'target' can ease direct comparison with the data as no further index alignment would be required. Compare:

| index: align = 'origin'  |  h.1 | h.2  | index: align = 'target'  | h.1  | h.2 |
|--------|------|----- | ------ | ---- | --- |
| 2026-08-03 | `1.0310` | `1.0315` | 2026-08-03 | NaN | NaN |
| 2026-08-04 | `1.2406` | 1.2337 | 2026-08-04 | `1.0310` | NaN |
| 2026-08-05 | 1.1138 | 1.1113 | 2026-08-05 | `1.2406` | `1.0315` |

```python
## Out-of-sample forecasts along with forecast losses can be accessed from class properties.
mv_forecasts = model_validator.forecasts  ## DataFrame containing index aligned out-of-sample forecasts
mv_mse = model_validator.mse_loss  ## DataFrame containing squared forecast errors
mv_qlike = model_validator.qlike_loss  ## DataFrame containing quasi-likelihood scores

## If alpha is passed, the class instance will also contain Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall forecasts
## which can be accessed from class properties
mv_var = model_validator.value_at_risk
mv_exp = model_validator.expected_shortfall

## Standardized residuals obtained from each iteration can be accessed via:
mv_resid = model_validator.std_residuals
```
>[!NOTE]
>Regardless of the index alignment method chosen for the out-of-sample forecasts, the indices of the standardized residuals are always 'origin' aligned, as they have to correspond to the last observation used to fit the model.

```python
## Finally, the model fit results from the last iteration can be accessed from the model_results property
mod1_fit = model_validator.model_fits[0]
mod2_fit = model_validator.model_fits[1]
```

## Extra Modules

### `Class LossContainer`
```python
class LossContainer(observations: np.ndarray,
                    forecasts: np.ndarray,
                    forecast_horizon: int = None)
```
Generic class for loss function calculations. It takes as input the array of model forecasts and the index-aligned observations and it calculates the MSE, MAE, and QLIKE loss of each forecast. The estimated loss series are stored as properties.
- LossContainer.mse_loss contains series of squared forecast errors.
- LossContainer.mae_loss contains series of absolute forecast errors.
- LossContainer.qlike_loss contains series of quasi-likelihood forecast scores.

The class can be optionally instantiated with `forecast_horizon` which will include the forecast horizon in the summary results.
observations: 1-Dimensional array of observations. Must be in the same units as the forecasts.

#### Parameters
- `observations`: 1-Dimensional array of observations. Must be in the same units as the forecasts.
- `forecasts`: 1-Dimensional or 2-dimensional array of model forecasts. Index must be 'target' aligned.
- `forecast_horizon`: Integer determining the forecast horizon.

#### Properties
- `mse_loss`: Series of h-step-ahead conditional variance squared error loss per model.
- `mae_loss`: Series of h-step-ahead conditional variance absolute error loss per model.
- `qlike_loss`: Series of h-step-ahead conditional variance quasi-likelihood score per model.

> [!NOTE]
> The Validator class automatically computes the loss series and handles index-alignment internally. Only use the LossContainer class if using an alternative forecasting scheme.
```python
from src.modules.loss_container import LossContainer

## assuming that the array of out-of-sample forecasts is stored in forecasts
## and the univariate array of observations (variance proxies in the case of volatility forecasts) is stored in observations
## then the class should be loaded as:
lc = LossContainer(observations, forecasts, forecast_horizon=1)
lc_mse = lc.mse_loss
print(lc_mse)

## average forecast losses
print(lc)
```
>[!NOTE]
>Make sure that the forecasts and the observations are in the same units and that the index of the forecasts is 'target' aligned.

Continuing the example from section [Usage Example](#usage-example):
```python
mv_index = mv_forecasts.index
observations = returns.loc[mv_index]**2
lc2 = LossContainer(observations, mv_forecasts, forecast_horizon=fh)
lc2_mse = lc2.mse_loss
print(lc2_mse)

## average forecast losses
print(lc2)
```

### `class GenParetoMLE`
This is a child class of statsmodels GenericLikelihoodModel to estimate the shape and scale parameters of a Generalized Pareto Distribution.
```python
class GenParetoMLE(endog: np.ndarray)
```
#### Parameters
- `endog`: Tail observations for GPD parameters estimation. Must already be centered.

#### Methods
- `fit()`:
  Fit the model. Method return type is GenericLikelihoodModelResults.
  Among the properties of the GenericLikelihoodModelResults are the estimated parameters which can be accessed via:
  
### Properties of GenericLikelihoodModelResults
- `params`: Estimated parameters.
  - `params[0]` contains the estimated shape parameter.
  - `params[1]` contains the estimated scale parameter.

```python
from src.modules.standard_diagnostics import GenParetoMLE
thresh = np.percentile(zs_0, 95)
ex_0 = zs_0[zs_0 > thresh] - thresh
gp_model = GenParetoMLE(ex_0)
gp_fit = gp_model.fit()
gp_fit.summary()

xi_hat = gp.params[0]
sigma_hat = gp.params[1]
```

### `hill_test`
This function is a generalization of the test for the heavy-tailedness via the Hill estimator. The asymptotic distribution of the shape parameter estimator $\hat{xi}$ minus its hypothesized value $\xi = 1/r$, where $r$ is the moment order being tested is normal with variance $(1+\xi)^2$:
```math
                        \sqrt(m)  (\hat{\xi} - \xi) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,(1+\xi)^2),
```        
where $m$ is the number of exceedances, ovvero the size of the series passed to the function. This motivates the test statistic:
```math
                 w = \sqrt(m)  (\hat{\xi} - \xi) / (1+\xi) \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
```
Parameters:
- `z`: Univariate array of centered exceedances above threshold. Must be the same array fed to GenParetoMLE.
- `moment_order`: Moment order being tested.
- `xi_hat`: MLE estimate of the shape parameter.
- `sigma_hat`: MLE estimate of the scale parameter.
- `bandwidth`: Optional. Number of bins to plot the histogram.
- `trim_quantile`: Optional | Default = 0.99. The cut-off quantile on the plot. By trimming the extreme values makes the plot tidier.
- `ax: Optional`: plt.Axes canvas on which to plot the empirical pdf of the input data along with the theoretical pdf of the Generalized Pareto Distribution with given shape and scale parameters.

Returns:
- `dict()` containing:
  - test statistic
  - critical value
  - p-value of the test
```python
from src.modules.standard_diagnostics import hill_test

## Hill's test
r = 4 ## Moment order being tested
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
hill_results = hill_test(ex_0, moment_order = r, xi_hat = xi_hat, sigma_hat = sigma_hat, ax=ax)
print(hill_results)
plt.show()
```
### `jb_test`
This function implements the Jarque-Bera test for asymptotic normality of the standardized residuals. It takes as input the sample data and returns the Jarque-Bera test statistic along with its associated critical value and the p-value of the test.

The Jarque-Bera test statistic is defined as
```math
                JB = T/6 (\hat{S}^2 + \frac{(\hat{K} - 3)^2}{4} ),
```
where $\hat{S}$ and $\hat{K}$ are sample estimates of Skewness and Kurtosis of the sample data. Under the null hypothesis that the sample data is normally distributed, the JB test statistic has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom:
```math
                JB \sim \mathcal{\chi}^2(2).
```
Parameters:
- `z`: Univariate array of standardized random variables.
Returns:
- `dict()` containing:
  - test statistic
  - critical value
  - p-value of the test

```python
from src.modules.standard_diagnostics import jb_test
jb_results = jb_test(zs_0)
print(jb_results)
```
